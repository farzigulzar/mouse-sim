# mouse-sim
In this program I have created a mouse simulator which follow the movement of the object detected in Camera
The camera will read the frames and in each frame red color is filtered out.
The list of contours is made and then its weighted centre is found out.
Finally the mouse cursor is moved to the centre calculated.
I am learning OpenCV and the concepts I have learned till now helped me to create this first project.
